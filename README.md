# Emerging Tech Assignment

The four folders in this repo contain the following:

<ul>
  <li>numpy-random: A jupyter notebook explaining the numpy.random package and demonstrating some if it's functions</li>
  <li>iris-dataset: A jupyter notebook explaining the iris dataset and containing a neural network which attempts to predict the different species of      flowers input</li>
  <li>mnist: A jupyter notebook explaining the mnist dataset and showing how to open and read zipped datasets into memory</li>
  <li>digit-recognition: A jupyter notebook explaining the digitrec.py script contained within the folder, and showing how the neural network can read and recognise different handwritten digits, taken from the mnist dataset</li>
</ul>

## Using these notebooks

In order to use these notebooks and python script, the following steps must be taken:

<ol>
  <li>Clone this repo to your local machine</li>
  <li>Download and install Anaconda, this should install all the nessessary python packages and jupyter</li>
  <li>Open your console, navigate to the downloaded repo on your machine, and run "jupyter lab"</li>
  <li>Once jupyter lab has opened in your browser, open the desired notebook from the left, and then open the 'Run' tab along the top and select 'Run All'</li> 
</ol>

## Running the python script

The python script, contained in the digit-recognition folder, can be run either from the top of the digit-recognition notebook, or can be run from console by navigating into the digit-recognition folder, and running "python digitrec.py"
